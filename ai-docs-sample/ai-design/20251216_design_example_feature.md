# Design Document: User Input Validator

## Feature Overview

**Feature Name**: User Input Validator
**Date**: 20251216
**Author**: AI Assistant
**Status**: Approved

### Executive Summary
A robust input validation system that validates user input against defined schemas, failing hard on invalid data to ensure data integrity throughout the application.

### Problem Statement
The application currently lacks a centralized, consistent approach to validating user input. This leads to:
- Inconsistent validation rules across different endpoints
- Silent failures that corrupt downstream data
- Difficult-to-debug data integrity issues
- Security vulnerabilities from unvalidated input

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All user input validated against strict schemas
- [ ] Invalid input causes immediate failure with clear errors
- [ ] Validation rules are centralized and reusable
- [ ] 100% test coverage for validation logic
- [ ] Performance overhead <5ms per validation

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements
1. **Schema Definition**
   - Support for common data types (string, number, boolean, array, object)
   - Custom validation rules (regex, min/max, required fields)
   - Nested object validation
   - Array item validation

2. **Validation Execution**
   - Validate input against schema
   - Return validated data (with type coercion where appropriate)
   - Throw descriptive errors on validation failure
   - No partial validation - all or nothing

3. **Error Reporting**
   - Clear error messages indicating what failed
   - Path to the failing field in nested structures
   - Expected vs. actual type information
   - Multiple errors reported at once

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Validation completes in <5ms for typical payloads
   - Minimal memory overhead
   - Efficient for deeply nested structures

2. **Security**
   - Prevent prototype pollution
   - Sanitize error messages to prevent information leakage
   - Limit recursion depth to prevent DoS

3. **Usability**
   - Simple, intuitive schema definition
   - Clear documentation with examples
   - TypeScript support for type inference

### Constraints
- Must integrate with existing error handling
- Cannot use external validation libraries (per project policy)
- Must support both CommonJS and ES modules
- Node.js 18+ required

## Context Investigation

### Repository Analysis
The codebase follows these patterns:
- Error handling uses custom error classes in `src/errors/`
- Utilities are organized in `src/utils/`
- All features have dedicated directories under `src/features/`
- Tests mirror source structure under `tests/`

### Technical Stack
- Language: JavaScript/Node.js
- Testing: Jest with 90% coverage requirement
- Linting: ESLint with strict ruleset
- Build: No build step, direct Node.js execution

### Code Standards
- Fail-hard error handling throughout
- Descriptive error messages
- JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Functional programming preferred where appropriate

## Proposed Solution

### High-Level Approach
Create a schema-based validation system that defines rules declaratively and validates input data against these rules. The system will fail immediately on any validation error, providing detailed error information for debugging.

### Component Design

1. **Schema Builder**
   - Purpose: Define validation rules in a declarative way
   - Responsibilities:
     - Construct validation schemas
     - Validate schema definitions themselves
     - Provide fluent API for schema building
   - Interfaces:
     - `Schema.object()`, `Schema.string()`, etc.
     - Schema combination methods

2. **Validator Engine**
   - Purpose: Execute validation logic against schemas
   - Responsibilities:
     - Traverse input data and schema in parallel
     - Collect all validation errors
     - Throw comprehensive error on failure
   - Interfaces:
     - `validate(data, schema)` - Main validation function
     - Returns validated data or throws

3. **Error Reporter**
   - Purpose: Format validation errors clearly
   - Responsibilities:
     - Build descriptive error messages
     - Include paths to failing fields
     - Aggregate multiple errors
   - Interfaces:
     - `ValidationError` class with detailed info

### Data Flow
1. User defines schema using Schema Builder
2. Input data received from user
3. Validator Engine validates data against schema
4. On success: Returns validated data
5. On failure: Error Reporter creates ValidationError
6. ValidationError thrown with all failure details

### Error Handling Strategy
- All validation failures result in thrown `ValidationError`
- No warnings or partial success - fail on first issue
- Errors include full context for debugging
- No try/catch suppression anywhere in the system

## Implementation Considerations

### Dependencies
- No external packages required
- Uses only Node.js built-ins

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each validator type
- Integration tests for complex schemas
- Edge cases: null, undefined, empty values
- Performance tests for large payloads
- Error message format tests

### Migration/Deployment
- No database changes required
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Can be adopted incrementally
- Backward compatible error format

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: External Validation Library (Joi/Yup)
- **Approach**: Use established validation library
- **Pros**: Battle-tested, full-featured, good documentation
- **Cons**: External dependency, larger bundle size, against project policy
- **Reason not chosen**: Project policy prohibits external validation libraries

### Alternative 2: TypeScript Type Guards
- **Approach**: Use TypeScript's type system for validation
- **Pros**: Type safety, no runtime overhead for valid data
- **Cons**: Only works at compile time, no runtime validation
- **Reason not chosen**: Need runtime validation for user input

### Alternative 3: JSON Schema Validation
- **Approach**: Use JSON Schema standard
- **Pros**: Industry standard, good tooling
- **Cons**: Complex for simple cases, performance overhead
- **Reason not chosen**: Overkill for our use cases, adds complexity

## Open Questions

1. Should we support async validation rules for database lookups?
   - Current design is sync-only for simplicity

2. How should we handle type coercion (e.g., "123" to 123)?
   - Current design does minimal coercion for safety

## Decisions Needed

1. Maximum nesting depth for schemas
   - Option A: 10 levels (recommended)
   - Option B: 20 levels
   - Option C: Configurable
   - Recommendation: Option A - prevents DoS while supporting real use cases

2. Error message format
   - Option A: Single string with all errors
   - Option B: Structured object with error array (recommended)
   - Option C: First error only
   - Recommendation: Option B - provides most debugging value
